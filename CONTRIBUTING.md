### 🎨 Style Guide

To keep the codebase consistent and easy to read, please follow these guidelines:

-   **Match the existing coding style.** Look at the existing code to get a feel for the patterns used.
-   Follow standard C#/.NET naming conventions (e.g., `PascalCase` for methods, properties, and classes; `camelCase` for local variables).
